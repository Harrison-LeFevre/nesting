# DeepNest for Rhino
Open source nesting plugin for Rhino, based on Deepnest: https://github.com/Jack000/Deepnest

Deepnest is an open source nesting application, great for laser cutters, plasma cutters, and other CNC machines.

## Automatic line merging
Deepnest packs your parts into a compact area to save material and time. It automatically merges common lines so the laser doesn't cut the same path twice.
This not only saves time but improves part quality by avoiding heat warping from multiple laser passes.

## Automatic line merging
Deepnest employs a state of the art part layout engine with part-in-part placement and the ability to nest bitmap images for laser engraving

## Task list
- [x] Integrate Deepnest library
- [ ] Create a basic command to manage the nesting
- [ ] Create a basic component for Grasshopper
